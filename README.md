### Overview 
NFL's Big Data Bowl is a yearly competition that uses their ['Next Gen Stats'](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/) player tracking data to create actionable statistics. This year's comptetition focuses on movement before the snap of the ball. Players have 40 seconds after each play has ended to any substitutions, figure out formations and type play, and make any last adjustments. 

### My Current Progress
Right now, I am just looking around the data and seeing what Amon-Ra St. Brown was doing, apparently he has two rush plays that I am looking into.

Day 2: This is much more of a reading and seeing what is possible day. I am learning more about plotly and looking at past competitions winners to see how I should set up a notebook and what kind of questions I should be asking

Day 3: I found a book to read to get to understand more about the strategy of football called Take Your Eye off the Ball, might read this or find another book. Also got to make a more complex plotly graph.

Day 4: Cleaning up the notebook to be more concise, then I hope to find a way to include more plays than just one play at a time, I wonder if there is a way to create a heatmap...

Day 5: I was able to find a way to get it so every play in the game against the Commanders that led to an Amon-Ra St. Brown reception start at an origin (0,0) so it looks a little like this:

Day 6: Was finally able to flip the plays going to the left, so that all plays look like they are going to the right (no idea if I should flip it upside down or not yet). Now I can worry about making a heatmap.

Day 7: Heatmap did not take so long to figure out, the next thing I need to do is compare it with the plays Amon-Ra St. Brown did not get the ball or failed to catch the ball.

Day 8: With limited time today, I decided to just take it easy and just get to learn Kaggle's markdown capabilities. I currently have an image at the top and made a nice little markdown box with the main title.

Day 9: Finished the heatmaps, looking at it now, I do not know if there is enough information in the visualization to say anything conclusive. So I am going to analyze time difference between Amon-Ra plays and non-Amon-Ra plays and see what I can conclude from there.
