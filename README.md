### Overview 
NFL's Big Data Bowl is a yearly competition that uses their ['Next Gen Stats'](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/) player tracking data to create actionable statistics. This year's comptetition focuses on movement before the snap of the ball. Players have 40 seconds after each play has ended to any substitutions, figure out formations and type play, and make any last adjustments. 

### My Current Progress
Right now, I am just looking around the data and seeing what Amon-Ra St. Brown was doing, apparently he has two rush plays that I am looking into.
